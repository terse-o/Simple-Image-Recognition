Simple Image Recognition Model

Language: Python (v3.7)
Editor: PyCharm Community Edition (v2019.1.3)
Interpreter: Anaconda
Descirption: AI model created and trained using CIFAR 10 dataset to predict within a certain degree of accuracy an
image and what that image represents, and then assign it one of about 10 different labels.

NOTE:
Hello friends, I am writing this message to explain my motivation and approach towards building this project.
Through my academic curriculum, I am specializing in Data Analytics and Science. Introduciton to courses revolving
around Data Management and Database Design, Data Warehousing and Business Intellegence and Data Mining & Machine
Learning piqued my interest in Data Sciece and Machine Learning Algorithms. Learning more about these fields made
me realize that the knowledge was never enough and in order to get better and stay up-to-date I had to start
self-learn whatever I was interested in. This motivated me to learn Python Programming language on my own through
e-learning sites like Udemy and DataCamp. After getting comfortable with the language I decided to work on some
individual projects to get a better understanding of programming logics and several prominently used packages.
This is one of those individual projects.

To learn about the use of prominent package like tensorflow in the context Image Recognition systems, I completed
a course on Udemy titled "Learn Python AI for Image Recognition and Fraud Detection" by top-rated instructor,
John Bura from Mammoth Interactive. Brilliantly put forward, this beginner level course instructs how to combine
Python and TensorFlow powers to build projects. Unfortunately, the online course is no longer available for purchase
on Udemy.

Basic packages applied in this project are PIL, keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, cifar-10, numpy. 

OVERVIEW:
-Install necessary dependencies (cifar-10)
-Input, explore and manipulate dataset using PIL (Python Image Library) and matplotlib
-Build model using keras layers and train it using cifar-10 dataset
-Create test model to input any image and predict a label using trained model
