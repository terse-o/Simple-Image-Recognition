**Simple Image Recognition Model**

**Language:** Python (v3.7)

**Editor:** PyCharm Community Edition (v2019.1.3)

**Interpreter:** Anaconda

**Descirption:** AI model created and trained using CIFAR 10 dataset to predict within a certain degree of accuracy an
image and what that image represents, and then assign it one of about 10 different labels.

**NOTE:**
Basic packages applied in this project are *PIL, keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, cifar-10, numpy*.

**OVERVIEW:**

-Install necessary dependencies (cifar-10)

-Input, explore and manipulate dataset using PIL (Python Image Library) and matplotlib

-Build model using keras layers and train it using cifar-10 dataset

-Create test model to input any image and predict a label using trained model
