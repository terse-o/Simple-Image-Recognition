Simple Image Recognition Model

Language: Python (v3.7)

Editor: PyCharm Community Edition (v2019.1.3)

Interpreter: Anaconda

Descirption: AI model created and trained using CIFAR 10 dataset to predict within a certain degree of accuracy an
image and what that image represents, and then assign it one of about 10 different labels.

NOTE:
Basic packages applied in this project are PIL, keras, tensorflow, matplotlib, cifar-10, numpy. 

OVERVIEW:

-Install necessary dependencies (cifar-10)

-Input, explore and manipulate dataset using PIL (Python Image Library) and matplotlib

-Build model using keras layers and train it using cifar-10 dataset

-Create test model to input any image and predict a label using trained model
